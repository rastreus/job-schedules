### About

In an effort to better learn the functional programming paradigm,
and more specifically, the [Haskell programming language](https://www.haskell.org), I am working through some programming puzzles in my spare time. These problems are from the course [COMP 349: Applied Algorithms](http://www.harding.edu/academics/colleges-departments/sciences/computer-science/courses-offered) at [Harding University](http://www.harding.edu).

An explanation of the problem is located in the `info` folder of this repo.
Source code is located in the `src` folder and is licened under the GNU GPLv3.
Copyright information is located in the `COPYING` file in the root of this repo.
Additional information on the GNU GPLv3 license is located at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.  

_*Coursework is only allowed in C++ or Java so this isn't too helpful for current students.*_
